Will education be provided by Artificial Intelligence? 
In my opinion, not any time soon. At least for the near future, I think human teachers will continue to be the best way to teach human students! However, I think we can absolutely expect AI to be an important tool to enhance and augment teaching. 
We’re on the cusp of seeing new tools emerge which will draw from Artificial Intelligence and neurotechnology to provide truly personalized learning, tailored to each students’ passions, capabilities and unique ways of thinking. 
When the technology can learn about and respond to our thoughts as we learn, we’ll arrive at more efficient and optimized ways of passing on knowledge.
